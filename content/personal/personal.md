### 🎸 Music & Hobbies
Music is my biggest hobby and passion. I love listening and playing music whenever I get a chance. Guitar is my favorite instrument, but I also love piano. I have a pretty solid record collection that I have grown with my dad. My favorite band of all time is The Beatles, but i've been listening to a lot of Prince lately. Outside of music I love sports, movies, and cars. Unfortunately, I am a die-hard Bengals and Reds fan.
