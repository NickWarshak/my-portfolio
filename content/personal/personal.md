### 🎸 Music & Hobbies
Music is my biggest hobby and pasion outside of the business world. I love listening and playing music whenever I get a Chance. Guitar is my favorite instrument, but I also love piano. My favorite band of all time is The Beatles, but i've been listening to a lot of Prince lately.
